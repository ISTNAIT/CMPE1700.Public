#1: That's not ink, and it's also not toner.
@BillNineTheCodingGuy opened this issue 89 days ago.  [closed] 
[marking]

    Copier tech here. I was called out to assist a customer with changing her toner, as she couldn't figure out how. I 
    knew this was a relatively new customer, and I had done the install, so I also knew that she was a sweet little older 
    lady, so I was happy to go. I arrived and was greeted with the usual "Oh thank goodness, i'm so happy you are here!" 
    I love those greetings, so anyway, I follow her to her office to get to the small Kyocera M2535 desktop copier, and 
    there she stands, holding 2 items. She says, "I'm so sorry to have called you for something so silly, but i cannot 
    figure out where these inks go". Bless her heart. I said "well, those are laptop batteries, so i'm sure glad you 
    waited for me". LOL. poor thing. She said "well, see this is why i'm so glad to have you". She laughed and we found 
    the toner and i changed it for her. I thought we were done, then she asks "But where does the ink go?".

    Finally figured it out.  It wasn't working because of something you said.
    You said to add one, we just flip the first 0 from the right edge to a 1, so that's what I was doing and it kept 
    failing.

    Program accepts names as args.
    It deals one hand and evals the winner.
    It does have tie breaking measures for the first level of a tie.
    Ex: pair of king and pair of jack the pair of king wins
    However no tie breaking for two levels of ties
    Ex: pair of king and pair of king Tie is declared between the two.
