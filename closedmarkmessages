#1: Lab 1 - Ready to Mark
@JesseFederkiewicz opened this issue 58 days ago.  [closed] 

    Extrapolation:
     It appears that per bit increase the average number of
    runs increases by 0.25. Thus you can find the number of
    runs with the expression (0.25 * n) + 0.25
    
    Thus, 32 bits would be (0.25 * 32) + 0.25 which is 8.25 average runs.
    64 bits would be (0.25 * 64) + 0.25 which is 16.25 average runs.
